A super simple circular progress view for iOS that you can customize in Storyboard, or in code. It's lightweight and performant - uses CAShapeLayers to do drawing and CADisplayLink to update you on the progress.

##Usage

You can create an instance in code, or by dragging a UIView into your Storyboard and setting the subclass and module.

Here's how you set the progress
####Swift
```swift
progressView.setProgress(value: random, animated: true, duration: 1, completion: nil)
```
####Objective-C
```objective-c
[self.progressView setProgressWithValue:0.5 animated:YES duration:1 completion:nil];
```

If you want to perform some work while the progress is changing, like update a label, set the `progressChanged` property

####Swift
```swift
 let progressChanged: (CircularProgressView, CGFloat) -> () = { [unowned self]
      (progressView, progress) in
      let value = Int(progress * 100.0)
      self.centralLabel.text = "\(value)%"
}
        
progressView.progressChanged = progressChanged
```

####Objective-C
```objective-c
   __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
    self.progressView.progressChanged =  ^(CircularProgressView *progressView, CGFloat progress) {
        __strong typeof(self) self = weakSelf;
        self.label.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%ld", (long)progress];
    };
```

`CircularProgressView` is designable in Storyboard. You can set width and color of the border/progress layers as well as the progress value.
